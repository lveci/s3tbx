<h3>Algorithm Specification</h3>

<p>Retrieval of water constituents, or its optical properties, requires inversion of the water leaving reflectance spectrum, measured at top of
    atmosphere by ocean colour satellites. The C2RCC processor uses a large database of radiative transfer simulations inverted by
    neural networks as basic technology.</p>

<p>The general concept described in ATBD for MERIS 4th reprocessing data is also applicable to the other sensor like, S2-MCI, S3-OLCI and Landsat8:<br>
